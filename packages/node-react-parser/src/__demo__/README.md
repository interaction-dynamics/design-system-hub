# Demo

Sometimes a visual demo is worth a thousand words. So this folder includes how to use the parser in a real-world example.

This is not production code and it is not released to npm. It is just a demo to show how the parser can be used.

## Getting started

At the root of the project, run:

```bash
pnpm demo ./src/__fixtures__/one-component

# For larger examples
pnpm demo ../../examples/with-tokens-tailwind/src/libs
```
