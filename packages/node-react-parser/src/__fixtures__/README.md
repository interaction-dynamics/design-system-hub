# Fixtures

This is a collection of all use cases that should be supported by the parser. The goal is to have a comprehensive list of all possible ways to use React components and their props.

## All use cases

In order to be exhaustive and to have a good coverage of tests, we need to include all possible ways to use components and props.
In the `all-use-cases` folder, we have a collection of all possible ways to use components and props. The files are isolated since the tests will be run on each file separately. The goal there is to be exhaustive.

## Other folders

In the other folders, we have more complex examples that are not isolated. They are more like real-world examples where components are used in a more complex way.
